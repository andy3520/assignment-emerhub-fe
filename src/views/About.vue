          class="my-2"
        >Since 2018 we have been building our own databases including all of the registered private companies in Indonesia, Vietnam, and the Philippines. We do that by working with various governmental institutions that maintain their own databases, are usually scattered, and combine it into useful information for our customers.</p>

          <li>The company is not incorporated or is already liquidated</li>
